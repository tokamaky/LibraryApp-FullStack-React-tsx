Note: 
1 .ts(TypeScript)
    A .ts file is used for writing TypeScript code.
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
    In a .ts file, you can write both TypeScript and JavaScript code.
    TypeScript code allows you to define types, interfaces, and perform type checking during compilation,
     making it easier to catch certain types of errors early in development.

2 .tsx (TypeScript JSX):
    A .tsx file is used for writing TypeScript code that includes JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax.
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is often associated with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    In a .tsx file, you can write TypeScript code with JSX expressions, which allows you to define and render React components.
    .tsx files are commonly used in React applications to combine TypeScript's type checking with JSX for building user interfaces.



JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) are both programming languages that are closely related, but they have some key differences:

Static Typing:

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and you can change the type of a variable during execution. JavaScript does not enforce strict type checking, which can lead to runtime errors that can be challenging to debug.
TypeScript (TS): TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. It introduces a type system that allows you to define variable types at development time. TypeScript catches type-related errors during compilation, providing more robust type checking and better tooling for code editors. This can lead to fewer runtime errors and improved code quality.

Type Annotations:

JavaScript (JS): In JavaScript, you do not explicitly annotate variable types. Variables can hold values of any type.
TypeScript (TS): In TypeScript, you can explicitly annotate variable types using TypeScript-specific syntax. For example, you can declare a variable as let x: number = 5; to indicate that x should hold a numeric value.

Development Tooling:

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript lacks strong development tooling for type checking and code navigation. While there are tools like ESLint and JSHint for code quality, they don't provide the same level of static analysis and code intelligence as TypeScript.
TypeScript (TS): TypeScript includes robust development tools, such as TypeScript-aware code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code) that provide autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring support. These tools enhance productivity and code quality.

Compatibility:

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript code can run in any modern web browser and on the server (e.g., Node.js). It's widely supported and used for web development.
TypeScript (TS): TypeScript code must be transpiled (converted) into JavaScript before it can run in a browser or on a server. This transpilation step ensures compatibility with all JavaScript environments.

Community and Ecosystem:

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript has a vast and mature ecosystem with countless libraries, frameworks, and resources. It's the language of the web.
TypeScript (TS): TypeScript has gained popularity, especially in the context of large-scale applications and projects. Many popular libraries and frameworks, such as Angular and React, offer TypeScript support or typings.

Learning Curve:

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript has a relatively low entry barrier and is accessible to beginners. It's often used as the first language for web development.
TypeScript (TS): TypeScript introduces additional complexity with type annotations and concepts. It might have a steeper learning curve for newcomers to programming or web development.

In summary, TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds static typing and tooling support to the language. It can lead to more maintainable and less error-prone code, especially in large projects, but it requires developers to learn and use TypeScript-specific features. JavaScript, on the other hand, is the foundational language of the web and is simpler to get started with but may lead to more runtime errors in complex applications. The choice between JS and TS depends on project requirements, team familiarity, and development goals.
