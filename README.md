# Full Stack Web Application with React and Spring Boot

## Project Overview
This project is a Full Stack web application developed using React and Java Spring Boot. It incorporates features such as Stripe credit card payments, JWT-based authentication, and user role management. The application employs a modular design, ensuring streamlined development and enhanced scalability.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic UI/UX**: Built an interactive and responsive front-end with React to enhance user experience.
- **Secure Backend**: Implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, incorporating JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Designed and implemented user authentication and role management with Spring Security and OAuth2.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated Stripe for seamless credit card payment processing.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Adopted a modular design for better maintainability and scalability.

## Technology Stack

### Front-end
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Stripe API**: For integrating payment processing.
- **React Router**: For routing within the application.

### Back-end
- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework used to build stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Security**: For securing the application with authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication in a secure way.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing data.

### Development Tools
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: For Java development with Spring Boot.
- **Visual Studio Code**: For front-end development.
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and build automation.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application for easy deployment.

### Testing & Debugging
- **JUnit**: For writing unit tests in Java.
- **Postman**: For manual API testing.

### Version Control
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the code repository.

### Deployment
- **Railway**: For deploying the full-stack application.


## Development Tools and Frameworks
- **Maven and npm**: Streamlined dependency management to improve development efficiency.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application for consistent deployments.

## Project Highlights
- Delivered a secure and scalable Full Stack application.
- Integrated modern authentication methods to ensure data privacy and secure role-based access control.
- Developed a responsive front-end with an engaging user interface.
